## Project Description
A pure Ruby library for the web application asset discovery and tracking. The tool is useful when you're handling a larger size organization with multiple Internet domains and networks registered under the name. Where both legacy and new web applications are omni-present but nobody seems to be able to provide a complete list of application URLs to you. Yes you can always do it the old way by using tool sets such as NMAP, OWASP Zap web crawler, along with others. But such tool sets could quickly become too much manual-driven and inaccurate, if not impossible. In the contrary, once setup, this project will help you quickly identify all the 'unknown' web application assets, and keep track of them automatically. If you are serious about your organization's Internet web application exposure, this might be the perfect all-in-one footprinting tool you're looking for.
